### General information

### RSS methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

### RSS methods based on Variational Bayes (VB)

### Estimate linkage disequilibrium (LD)

> Q: The shrinkage estimator of LD in [Wen and Stephens (2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21479081) requires the "scaled population recombination rate" (`rho_ij`). How do I compute it?

You can easily figure out how to calculate this quantity if you carefully read [Li and Stephens (2003)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14704198) and [Wen and Stephens (2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21479081). TBA
