Below are instructions for installing RSS software.

## [RSS via MCMC](RSS-via-MCMC)

This page shows how to install the
[`MATLAB` scripts](https://github.com/stephenslab/rss/tree/master/src)
that implement Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) algorithms to fit RSS models.

These scripts have been tested in the following environments:

- version 8.4.0.150421 (R2014b) of `MATLAB` for 64-bit Linux
- version 8.2.0.701 (R2013b) of `MATLAB` for 64-bit Linux
- version 8.1.0.604 (R2013a) of `MATLAB` for 64-bit Linux

## [RSS via VB](RSS-via-VB)

This page shows how to install the
[`MATLAB` scripts](https://github.com/stephenslab/rss/tree/master/src_vb)
that implement Variational Bayes (VB) algorithms to fit RSS models.

These scripts have been tested in the following environments:

- version 8.4.0.150421 (R2014b) of `MATLAB` for 64-bit Linux
- version 8.2.0.701 (R2013b) of `MATLAB` for 64-bit Linux
- version 8.1.0.604 (R2013a) of `MATLAB` for 64-bit Linux
