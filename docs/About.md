## Overview

Regression with Summary Statistics (RSS) is a suite of Bayesian methods
that can learn the following multiple regression model

\\[{\bf y}={\bf X}{\boldsymbol\beta}+{\boldsymbol\epsilon}\\]

directly from summary statistics of univariate regressions.
More information TBA.

RSS is based on the statistical framework introduced in the following papers:
